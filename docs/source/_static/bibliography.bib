	abstract = {Efforts to computationally characterize large numbers of nanoporous materials often rely on databases of experimentally resolved crystal structures. The accuracy of experimental crystal structures used in such calculations has a significant impact on the reliability of the results. In this work, we report structures optimized using periodic density functional theory (DFT) for more than 800 experimentally synthesized metal{\textendash}organic frameworks (MOFs). Many MOFs changed significantly upon structural optimization, particularly materials that were crystallographically resolved in their solvated form. For each MOF, we simulated the adsorption of CH4 and CO2 using grand canonical Monte Carlo both before and after DFT optimization. The DFT optimization has a large impact on simulated gas adsorption in some cases. For example, CO2 loading at 1 bar changed by more than 25\% in over 25\% of the MOFs we considered.},

	abstract = {In this work, a computation-ready, experimental covalent organic framework (CoRE COF) database that nearly covers all the existing COFs was constructed and provided, which contains 187 COFs with disorder-free and solvent-free structures. Using the CoRE COF database established, structure-property relationships of COFs for Kr/Ar, Xe/Kr and Rn/Xe separations were studied. The conditions of industrial vacuum (VSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes were considered in the computation. Qualitative rules of COFs for noble gas separations were clarified, and structural features of COFs with excellent separation performance were summarized and suggested. In addition, COFs with good separation performance were identified from our database for industrial cyclic process. The knowledge obtained in this work may give guidance for experimental efforts in seeking advanced materials for noble gas separation, and the CoRE COF database will facilitate the fundamental research of COFs as well as the development of novel functional materials toward practical applications.},

	isbn = {978-1-60198-396-1},
	abstract = {This monograph reviews both the theory and practice of the numerical computation of geodesic distances on Riemannian manifolds. The notion of Riemannian manifold allows one to define a local metric (a symmetric positive tensor field) that encodes the information about the problem one wishes to solve. This takes into account a local isotropic cost (whether some point should be avoided or not) and a local anisotropy (which direction should be preferred). Using this local tensor field, the geodesic distance is used to solve many problems of practical interest such as segmentation using geodesic balls and Voronoi regions, sampling points at regular geodesic distance or meshing a domain with geodesic Delaunay triangles. The shortest paths for this Riemannian distance, the so-called geodesics, are also important because they follow salient curvilinear structures in the domain. We show several applications of the numerical computation of geodesic distances and shortest paths to problems in surface and shape processing, in particular segmentation, sampling, meshing and comparison of shapes. All the figures from this review paper can be reproduced by following the Numerical Tours of Signal Processing. http: //www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/ peyre/numerical-tour/ Several textbooks exist that include description of several manifold methods for image processing, shape and surface representation and computer graphics. In particular, the reader should refer to [42, 147, 208, 209, 213, 255] for fascinating applications of these methods to many important problems in vision and graphics. This review paper is intended to give an updated tour of both foundations and trends in the area of geodesic methods in vision and graphics},
